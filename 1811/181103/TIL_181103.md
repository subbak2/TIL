Today I Learned. 18.11.03.

 Today I reviewed C, and DFS algoritm. Before using DP, and bit masking, I reviewed DFS by solving TSP(Traveling Salesman Problem).

For solving problem
0) Global variables : cost matrix, visit matrix, N, sol
1) Input cost data using matrix
2) If new cost is cheaper than older one, mark visit matrix and go one level (DFS)
3) Brute-force search

 In this way, I can find answer anyway. But if there are more than 15 or 16 cities, processing speed is exceed about 2 seconds.
 This means "time limit" in many algorithm websites. So tomorrow I'll use DP, and bit masking to solve TSP again.
