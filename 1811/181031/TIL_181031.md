Today I Learned. 18.10.31.

 My first programming language was C, so I was used to make algorithms or codes with process-oriented programming. 
But my company want me to make codes with object-oriented programming, so I'm now studying JAVA and OOP.

By making today's codes. I concentrated on modulation, and MVC modeling. 
So I divided packages into five parts; business_logic(Model), domain_object(Model), ui(View), controller(Controller), and exception.

Today's program includes five functions;dividing books and magazines, registering lists, searching books by using ISBN, saving lists, and loading lists.
