Today I Learned. 18.11.08.

 Today I review JDBC, and practice some queries, and DMLs by making book database.
Compared to yesterday's codes, I divide code into DAO, VO, and Testing class, and use PreparedStatement instead of Statement.

Never forget!!
1) Driver class loading - Class.forName("DRIVER_NAME");
2) Create connection - Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("DB_URL", "DB_USER", "DB_PASSWORD"); --> modulation is needed, because of performance

3-0) set sql (String sql = "";) // remember "?"'s function
3) Create statement - PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql);
3-1) sql.setString("");

4) Execute - stmt.executeQuery(); (query)
   Execute - stmt.executeUpdate(); (DML)

5) ResultSet (only in query) rs = stmt.executeQuery(sql);

6) Release resource --> very important for retaining performance in multi-thread environment
