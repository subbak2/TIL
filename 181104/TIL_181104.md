Today I Learned. 18.11.04.

Today I reviewed MVC modeling, singletone pattern, saving objects, loading objects, and network transfer via IP address.

Mistakes
1) Thread.join() -> wait until a thread is over.
2) ObjectInputStream/Output -> using int to know size of objects(WriteInt, ReadInt methods)
3) ActionListner, Singletone pattern -> not practiced.
