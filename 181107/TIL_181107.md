Today I started study JDBC, there are 5 or 6 steps to query or manipulate db in java code.

1) Driver class loading
  Class.forName("DRIVER_NAME");
2) Create connection
  Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("DB_URL", "DB_USER", "DB_PASSWORD");
3) Create statement
  Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
4) Execute
  stmt.executeQuery(sql); (query)
  
5) ResultSet  (only in query)
  rs = stmt.executeQuery(sql);
6) Release resource
