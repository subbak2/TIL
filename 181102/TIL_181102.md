Today I Learned. 18.11.02. Friday!!!!

 Today I learned multithread and network. For making sure only one client access data at once, I use multithread to lock data.
 By using "synchronized", make thread wait in lock pool, and by using "notify", make thread acquire flag and runnable.
 
 In order to transfer data, I need to make several things. 
 1) server class, and client class
 2) serversocket, socket, bufferedreader, and printwriter
 3) multithread class (nested in server and client class)
 4) methods ; go, broadcast, addClient in list(server),  removeClient in list(server)
